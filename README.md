# Down Syndrome Detection using Deep CNN

-This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting Down Syndrome from images. Using deep learning techniques, the model aims to identify visual patterns associated with Down Syndrome, potentially providing a support tool for early diagnosis.
- Develop a CNN model capable of distinguishing between images of individuals with and without Down Syndrome.
- Achieve high accuracy in detecting Down Syndrome using pre-processed image datasets.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Features
- Image Pre-processing: Prepares images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting to improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- CNN Model Architecture: Implements a deep CNN with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers for feature extraction and classification.
- Model Evaluation: Provides visualizations of training accuracy and loss, and a classification report to analyze performance.

# Technologies Used
- Python (main language for implementation)
- TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model development
- OpenCV and NumPy for image pre-processing
- Matplotlib for visualizing training and evaluation results
- Android studio
